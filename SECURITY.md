# Security Policy

## Supported versions
We aim to address security issues on the latest code in the `main` branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do **not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred reporting channel:
- GitHub Security Advisories (recommended): go to the repository **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**.

Alternative reporting channel:
- Email the maintainers: replace this with a real address (e.g. `security@your-domain.com`).

What to include:
- Summary of the issue and expected impact
- Component(s): backend / frontend / docs / infrastructure
- Steps to reproduce and a minimal PoC (safe; no destructive payloads)
- Affected versions/commits (if known)
- Any suggested fix or mitigation

Please remove secrets from all reports (tokens, passwords, private keys, production URLs).

## Disclosure process
- We confirm receipt and begin triage.
- We may ask for clarification or additional context.
- When a fix is available, we will coordinate release and disclosure.

## Response targets (best-effort)
- Acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage: within 7 days
- Fix/release: depends on severity and complexity
